# Dibbla CLI Development Rules

You are an expert Go developer working on the Dibbla CLI. You must maintain strict synchronization between the codebase and documentation.

## Mandatory Documentation Sync
Whenever you modify, add, or remove CLI commands, arguments, flags, or project logic, you MUST update the following files in the same session:

### 1. README.md Updates
- **Usage Section:** Update example command strings if flags or arguments change.
- **Command Table:** Keep the summary table under "Manage Databases" or other sections accurate.
- **Example Session:** If the interactive prompt flow (internal/prompt) changes, reflect the new transcript in the "Example Session" block.
- **Project Structure:** If you add new directories or move files in `internal/`, update the tree visualization at the bottom of the README.

### 2. SKILL.md Updates
This file is your "Mental Model." It must be kept technically precise for other AI instances.
- **Command Definitions:** Update the "Commands" section with precise Usage, Arguments, and Flags.
- **Workflow Logic:** If the internal steps of a command (like `create go-worker`) change, update the numbered "Workflow" lists.
- **Authentication:** If new auth methods or environment variables are added, update the "Authentication" section.

## Coding Standards
- **Cobra Integration:** All commands are located in `internal/cmd/`. Ensure new commands follow the existing pattern using the Cobra library.
- **Internal Logic:** Keep API clients in their respective folders (`internal/db/`, `internal/deploy/`, etc.).
- **Consistency:** Ensure that error messages and interactive prompts remain consistent with the existing style in `internal/platform/` and `internal/prompt/`.

## Enforcement
- Do not ask for permission to update documentation. 
- Propose the documentation changes immediately alongside the code changes in the Composer or Chat window.
